# Rule-7

Rule 7 is a Discord bot for all your hsquizbowl stat-checking needs. 

## Features

**Stat Aggregation:** Rule 7's database allows users to add stat reports from any hsquizbowl tournament report. NAQT keeps lifetime stats for players for their tournaments, but tournaments run on mACF sets have no such ability.

**Stat Visualization:** Rule 7 provides two ways to visualize stats. One generates bar graphs comparing the PPG, P/G, and N/G between two players, and the other generates a scatterplot graphing P/G against PPG for all players at a given tournament.

Other features can be found by running the command /help.
